{"id":99463,"xmlId":"Key Promoter X","name":"Key Promoter X","description":"\nThe Key Promoter X helps you to learn essential shortcuts while you are working.\nWhen you use the mouse on a button inside the IDE, the Key Promoter X shows you the keyboard shortcut that you\nshould have used instead. This provides an easy way to learn how\nto replace tedious mouse work with keyboard keys and helps to transition to a faster, mouse free development.\nThe Key Promoter X tool window shows you a hit-list of the mouse actions you use the most and directly provides you\nwith the shortcut you can use instead. For buttons that don't have a shortcut, the Key Promoter X prompts you with\nthe possibility to directly create one.\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=jbmarket&amp;utm_campaign=keypromoterx&amp;utm_medium=banner\" title=\"Try CodeStream\">\n    <strong>CodeStream</strong>:\n</a>\n\nRequest and perform code reviews from inside your IDE.\nReview any code, even if it's a work-in-progress that hasn't been committed yet, and use jump-to-definition,\nyour favorite keybindings, and other IDE tools.\n<a href=\"https://sponsorlink.codestream.com/?utm_source=jbmarket&amp;utm_campaign=keypromoterx&amp;utm_medium=banner\" title=\"Try CodeStream\">You\n    can try it for free!</a>\n<br>\n<br>\nI'd also like to give a big thanks to\n<a href=\"https://github.com/dbabiak\">Daniel Babiak</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sthagen\">Stefan Hagen</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/JoshuaLuckers\">Joshua LÃ¼ckers</a>,\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jlash13\">jlash13</a>, and\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mccorkle\">Mark McCorkle</a>\nfor sponsoring the Key Promoter X with $4 per\nmonth.
